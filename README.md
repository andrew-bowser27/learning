Learning how to use repository

This is not the first time I have followed this turtorial to making a GitHub repository - however it is the first time I am with purpose!
This will be a chance for me to explore what it feels like working on a team of programmers creating an app, a website, or whatever
So far, I am pumped! I will be learning CSS and then what felxbox and grids are. Definitely excited -- I can't stop thinking about it. During the day and while im in bed. 
This is all for now! 

I would like to thank myself for giving myself the opportunity to explore what I never thought was possible!
